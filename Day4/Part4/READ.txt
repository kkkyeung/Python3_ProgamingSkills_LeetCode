The question only need us to swap 2 position, thus I know if the difference place is not 2 which means they can swap or 0 which means they are the same thing, the output is false.

Then, I added the diff=[]  , and find that if they are not the same, I added 1 to the list, and finally calculate the sum of the list, if the result is not 0 or 2 , Output false, if 2 or 0, output True.
