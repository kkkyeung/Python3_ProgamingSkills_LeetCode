find the first index and last index, do the comparing and find if they are >  or <:
based on the > or < to do the different operation, if they are the same in the middle, just continue if they are the opposite, just return False.
one of the situation is that all the number in the list are the same, thus i use the set() function to set the list first, if the list length is 1 , which will return True as well.
