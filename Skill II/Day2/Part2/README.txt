The find() method returns -1 if the value is not found.


the solution by rsrs3 from :
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/discuss/94334/Easy-python-solution-with-explaination



basically this solution is based on the 2 strings combine together 
and check if we still can find the same input string in it.

if the find() function is not -1 meaning we can find the same things in here, if -1, we know the string is not containing the input string.
