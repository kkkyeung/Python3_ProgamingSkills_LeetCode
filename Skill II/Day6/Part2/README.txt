reverse the string, set a output to 0, then start to loop if the i is char, add 1 to output,  
otherwise just break the loop and return the output.

was thinking add the else in there, but thats not make sense.... since the test case ' ' and 'a' is so annoying@@
then I try to delete the else and just add the elif output instead.
