Concept:

based on the n in the function is int, so I need to test what is the stdout of the n first,
the answer is as I expected, n will be a number of the input,
In the example 1, 00000000000000000000000000001011 is 11, so n is 11.
Then, I will have to change the input "n" to the binary format, then change it to string to find how many "1" in there.
