set a variable to find if there is sharing a same x/y.

I set it dx and dy,  and the dx is equel to the x-r , and dy is equel to the y -c,
so each time we loop that , if there a same x/y, we know that dx / dy , one of this is equal to 0.
Then , using abs find absolute value and we can just find that index for the result.
