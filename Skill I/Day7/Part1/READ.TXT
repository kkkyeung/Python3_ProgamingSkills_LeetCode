*Start1 and Start2 is in the example.jpg.

First, we need to find the sum of the first line (primary diagonal) which is the "Start1",
then we need to find the sum of the second line(secondary diagonal) which is the "Start2".

Finally check if there is a odd list inside the list, if yes, the output need to - the mid number,
if not just simple return the output.
