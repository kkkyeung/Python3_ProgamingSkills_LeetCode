Actually the example description of the question is not that clear.
However, after I tried to print the output, I understand # ParkingSystem [1,1,0] means (big,medium,small) and 1 available in big , medium but 0 available in small.

Thus, I tried to just find if the int of the ParkingSystem is > 0, it will reduce the space of the car park, then return True, otherwise just return false.
