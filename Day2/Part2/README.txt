Concept:

I need to seperate each of the number of the input, and append those numbers to the empty list.
But the list will contain some string in there, then I need to change the string to the int of the list using map.
Then use the list() function to change the map to the list.
Now, we have the list containing each of the input number,
then I use the reduce(operator.mul, list) to multiply each of the number of the list, then just use the sum() to find the sum of the list.
Finally,  just return it to get the answer.
